# AI Agent Guidelines

## 📚 Onboarding
At the start of each session, read:
1. `README.md` - High-level project overview
2. `README.architecture.md` - Project structure and architecture
3. `README.process.md` - Commit standards and release workflows
4. `README.development.md` - Build commands and testing
5. `README.planning.md` - Spec creation and planning standards

## ✅ Quality Gates
When writing code, you must not finish until all of these succeed:
1. `npm run build` (Runs TypeCheck + Build)
2. `npm test` (Runs Vitest)
